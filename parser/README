       Jay reads the grammar specification in the file filename and generates an LR(1) parser for
       it.  The parsers consist of a set of LALR(1) parsing tables and a driver routine from  the
       file  skeleton  written in the Java programming language.  Jay writes the parse tables and
       the driver routine to standard output.
